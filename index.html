    <h3>Access Support</h3>

      <p>I support individuals and organisations to apply for funding if they need additional support. I generally offer support to neurodivergent people who may face barriers, struggle with meeting deadlines or expressing their ideas in writing.<p>
        
      <p> Some funders offer access schemes and applicants typically have to nominate a support worker who will assist them with the application process. If you're looking for assistance, please reach out for a conversation to see if I can support you!</p>  
    
      <p>I also work with individual artists or organisations to apply for Arts Council funding through the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/access-support">Access Support scheme</a>. I have previously supported neurodivergent artists to successfully secure funding through the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/dycp">Developing Your Creative Practice</a> fund. I've also supported organisations to submit complex large bids for Arts Council <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ProjectGrants">Project Grants</a>.</p> 

      <h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
    
      <p>I start with a conversation to get to know you and your particular needs. I will then devise a tailored plan based on this. Support could include:<p>

      <p>* note-taking and transcription<p>
      <p>* helping process the application and forms<p>
      <p>* support navigating online funding portals<p>
      <p>* signposting to other resources<p>
    
    <h3>Fundraising Consultancy</h3>

      <p>I offer a range of fundraising-related support to charitable organisations in the UK. Most of my experience is with grassroots and medium-sized charities and Community Interest Companies with a strong social justice approach.<p> 
        
      <p>I can work with you to find and apply for funding, develop a case for support, research new income streams, compile budgets for funders and more. I have a keen eye for detail, authenticity and argumentation and like to work flexibly with organisations to build sustainable funding sources. My day rate is between Â£250-300 depending on the resources of your organisation.<p>

      <p>I am particularly interested in working with organisations with a focus on migrants' rights, whether in the UK or abroad, and especially if they are led by people with lived experience.<p>
