    <h3>Access Support</h3>

      <p>I work with individuals and organisations to apply for funding if they need additional support. Most of my experiencing is working with neurodivergent people who may struggle to meet deadlines, express ideas clearly in writing or find it difficult to translate their ideas into the format required by funders.<p>
        
      <p> Some funders offer access schemes and applicants typically have to nominate a support worker who will assist them with the application process. If you're looking for assistance, please reach out for a conversation to see if I can support you!</p>  
    
      <p>I also work with individual artists or organisations to apply for Arts Council funding through the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/access-support">Access Support scheme</a>. You can apply for free access support if you're an individual artist or you work for an arts organisation and self-identity as neurodivergent, disabled or face health problems. I have previously supported neurodivergent artists to successfully secure funding through the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/dycp">Developing Your Creative Practice</a> fund. I've also supported organisations to submit complex large bids for Arts Council <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ProjectGrants">Project Grants</a>.</p> 

      <h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
    
      <p>I start with a conversation to get to know you and your particular needs. If you're applying for support through the Arts Council, I can explain how this works and help you fill out the form to apply for support. I will then devise a tailored support plan based on your needs, which could include:<p>

      <p>* taking notes and transcribing<p>
      <p>* talking through your ideas and helping you shape them into a coherent plan, at your own pace<p>
      <p>* helping you understand and fill out application forms<p>
      <p>* supporting you to navigate online funding portals, like the Arts Council portal Grantium<p>
      <p>* signposting you to other resources for help when needed<p>
    
    <h3>Fundraising Consultancy</h3>

      <p>I offer a range of fundraising-related support to charitable organisations in the UK. Most of my experience is with grassroots and medium-sized charities and Community Interest Companies with a strong social justice approach.<p> 
        
      <p>I can work with you to find and apply for funding, develop a case for support, research new income streams, compile budgets for funders and more. I have a keen eye for detail, authenticity and argumentation and like to work flexibly with organisations to build sustainable funding sources. My day rate is between Â£250-300 depending on the resources of your organisation.<p>

      <p>I am particularly interested in working with organisations with a focus on migrants' rights, whether in the UK or abroad, and especially if they are led by people with lived experience.<p>
