    <h1>Alice Troy-Donovan - Fundraising and Access Support for individuals and charities</h1>
    
    <h3>Access Support</h3>

      <p>I work with organisations to apply for funding if they have access barriers - for instance if staff are neurodivergent, or face health-related difficulties. Many funders offer access schemes and applicants typically have to dominate a support worker who will assist them with the application process. Feel free to reach out below for a conversation if you are looking for an access support worker!</p>  
    
      <p>I also support individual artists or organisations to apply for Arts Council funding through the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/access-support">Access Support scheme</a>. I have previously supported neurodivergent artists to successfully secure funding through the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/dycp">Developing Your Creative Practice</a> fund. I've also supported organisations to submit complex large bids for Arts Council <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ProjectGrants">Project Grants</a>.</p> 
        
      <p>I start with a conversation to get to know you and your particular needs. I will then devise a tailored plan based on this. Support could look like note-taking, breaking down the application into manageable tasks, and helping you get your ideas on paper.</p>
    
    <h3>Fundraising Consultancy for Organisations</h3>

      <p>I offer a range of fundraising-related support to charitable organisations in the UK. Most of my experience is with grassroots and medium-sized charities and Community Interest Companies with a strong social justice approach. I can work with you to find and apply for funding, develop a case for support, research new income streams, compile budgets for funders and more. I have a keen eye for detail, authenticity and argumentation and like to work flexibly with organisations to build sustainable funding sources.<p>

      <p>I am particularly interested in working with organisations with a focus on migrants' rights, whether in the UK or abroad, and especially if they are led by people with lived experience.<p>
