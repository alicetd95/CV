    <h1>Arts Council Access Support</h1>
    
    <h3>How it Works</h3>

      <p><strong>I support individual artists or organisations to apply for Arts Council funding through the Access Support scheme, which supports Deaf, disabled and neurodivergent people, as well as those experiencing poor health, to apply for Arts Council funding. I work with neurodivergent people and devise a tailored support plan depending on their needs. This could look like note-taking, helping you understand the requirements of funding programmes and the application process, planning your project and application, and support producing and editing text. I have previously supported large organisations to apply for Project Grants as well as individual arts seeking funding from the Developing Your Creative Practice Fund.</strong></p>
    
     <h3>Fundraising Consultancy for Organisations</h3>

          <p><strong>I offer a range of fundraising-related support to charitable organisations in the UK, with a particular interest in grassroots organising with a social justice focus. Support ranges from working with organisations to develop a persuasive case for support, to prospecting, research and compiling budgets for funders. I have a keen eye for detail, authenticity and argumentation and like to work flexibly with organisations to build sustainable funding sources. </strong></p>
